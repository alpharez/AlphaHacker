- You're a hacker into AlphaNet, a global network like the Internet.

- hostnames map to addresses in the form of nn.nnnn.  Kind
  of like Netware (net.host).
  
- You try to build a host to address list, try to crack your way in
  using a brute force cracker, then steal money.
  
- You use money to buy better HW and SW.

- To start with you have an email program.  You get SPAM mail every
  once in a blue moon, indicated by a mail icon.  Clicking on the 
  mail icon brings up your mailbox.  You get solicitations from
  vendors, which gives you hosts and addresses that you can crack.
  
- Cracking a host can get you cash, source code, credit card numbers,
  clues to other hosts, or software.

- later on you'll get offers to sell code and cc numbers.

- Only the highest level encryption can get you into Corps.

- If you take too long to crack a host, you'll be terminated and a
  nasty email may get sent by the admin to your ISP.  Too many of 
  these and you'll be disconnected.

* FiX: What I saw in NS Lookup was that when you go to it and try to type 
in the name line, it is spaced back some. Then when you try to type with 
the keyboard, you will see something like it saying 2-ghz like from the 
cpu update menu or you will see the last thing you typed in there from 
the previous message like one time I typed alpha.net and came back to NS 
Lookup, but it was not visible until I clicked on the on screen keyboard 
it was just some spaces it looked like, and alpha.net was still there. 
Another time it showed like some commands like that O with the ' above 
it with like a n or something, like a editor command?[/list]
